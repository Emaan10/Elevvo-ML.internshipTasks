# Student Exam Score Prediction:

This project predicts students’ exam scores based on factors such as study hours and other numeric features available in the dataset. It applies Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to evaluate performance and compare single-feature vs. multi-feature prediction accuracy.

## Features

- Cleans and preprocesses raw student performance data

- Visualizes the relationship between study hours and exam scores

- Trains and evaluates both Linear and Polynomial Regression models

## Compares results using

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

- MSE (Mean Squared Error)

- R² (Coefficient of Determination)

## Tests models on

- A single feature (study_hours)

- Multiple numeric predictors from the dataset

## Dataset

The dataset is provided as student_performance_factors.csv in the project directory.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python

- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization

- **Scikit-learn** for regression modeling and evaluation
