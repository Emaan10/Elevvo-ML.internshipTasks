# Student Exam Score Prediction:

This project predicts studentsâ€™ exam scores based on factors such as study hours and other numeric features available in the dataset. It applies Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to evaluate performance and compare single-feature vs. multi-feature prediction accuracy.

## Features:

Cleans and preprocesses raw student performance data

Visualizes the relationship between study hours and exam scores

Trains and evaluates both Linear and Polynomial Regression models

Compares results using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)

Tests models on:

A single feature (study_hours)

Multiple numeric predictors from the dataset

## Dataset

The dataset should be provided as student_performance_factors.csv in the project directory.
It must include an exam_score column (target variable) and other numeric features (e.g., study hours, attendance, etc.).
