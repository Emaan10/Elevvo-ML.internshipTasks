# Student Performance Prediction using Regression Models

This project explores **student performance prediction** based on various factors such as study hours and other numeric features.  
We apply **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models to predict students' exam scores, evaluate their performance using multiple metrics, and visualize the results.

## Dataset
- File used: **StudentPerformanceFactors.csv**  
- The dataset contains student-related factors (e.g., hours studied, attendance, family background, etc.)  
- Target variable: **`exam_score`**

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handles missing values
  - Renames columns to standardized lowercase format
- **Visualization**
  - Scatter plot of `hours_studied` vs `exam_score`
- **Modeling**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression (degree = 2 by default)
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - RÂ² Score
- **Comparison**
  - Single feature (`hours_studied`)
  - Multiple numeric features
